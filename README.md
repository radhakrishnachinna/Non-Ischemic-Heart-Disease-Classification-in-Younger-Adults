# Non-Ischemic-Heart-Disease-Classification-in-Younger-Adults
Young adults rarely develop ischemic heart disease (MI), so this project focuses entirely on non-ischemic cardiac disorders. The PTB-XL dataset provides rich ECG metadata which is used to train a machine learning model that predicts the type of non-ischemic heart condition based on demographic and ECG acquisition metadata.
