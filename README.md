🫀 Non-Ischemic Heart Disease Classification in Younger Adults Using Machine Learning

This project uses the PTB-XL ECG dataset (metadata only) to classify non-ischemic heart disease types in younger adults (<45 years old).
The goal is to distinguish between:

Structural Heart Diseases

Cardiomyopathy (CM)

Hypertrophy (HYP)

and

Non-Structural Heart Diseases

Conduction Disorders (CD)

Non-Diagnostic Patterns (NDT)

using machine learning techniques.
